finding the coordinates in the interlaced format is okay, but finding its match in the noninterlaced way eludes me. 
the adam7 image is 8x8: 
* find the first occurence of a subimage on a line it occurs, take its index on the line ( 0 indexed ), this is the number you add to the column before any multipliers
* count the occurences of a subimage in the adam7 imageline, divide 8 by this, the result is what you multiply the column + the number in the last point with, along with the pixelsize. 

* find the 0-index of the first occurence of a subimage in a column, increase the rownumber from the subimage with this number before any multiplication. 
* count the occurences of a subimage in the adam7 and divide 8 by this, this is the number you multiply the linenumber from the subimage with. 

-- 1: column index 0 and occurence 1; rowindex 0 and occurence 1;
(subimagecolumn+0) *(8/1) * pixelsize
(subimagerow   +0) *(8/1)*imageWidth*pixelsize
-- 2: column index 0 and occurence 1; rowindex 4 and occurence 1;
(subimagecolumn+



for subimage 1 I have to multiply the column by 8*pixelsize
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 8 adding zero
column*8*pixelsize + imageWidth*8*pixelsize+ 0;

for subimage 2 I have to multiply the column by 8*pixelsize adding 4
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 8 adding zero
(column+4 )*8*pixelsize  + imageWidth*8*pixelsize+ 0;



for subimage 3 I have to multiply the column by 4*pixelsize adding 0
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 8 adding 
4*pixelsize*column + 
8*imageWidth*(row+4) +0

for subimage 4 I have to multiply the column by 4*pixelsize adding 2
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 4 adding 0 lines
4*pixelsize*( column +2)+
4*imagewidth(row+ 0)

for subimage 5 I have to multiply the column by 2*pixelsize adding 0
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 4 adding 2 lines
2*pixelsize*( column )+
2*imagewidth(row+2) 

for subimage 6 I have to multiply the column by 2*pixelsize adding 1
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 2 adding 0 lines
2*pixelsize*( column +1)+
2*imagewidth(row+0)

for subimage 7 I have to multiply the column by pixelsize adding 0
-------------------------multiply the row    by imagewidth times 2 adding 1 lines
pixelsize*( column+0)+
2*imagewidth(row+1) +
