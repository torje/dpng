A png-reader in D

I failed at my first attempt at to get libpng working with D, probably a silly mistake regarding memory on my part, but since png is a simple format, I started parsing it myself. 

I intend the API to consist of functions/attributes to extract the image and the other required data, currently it is a clusterfuck.
